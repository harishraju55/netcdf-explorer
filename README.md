# netcdf-explorer
Desktop application to view NetCDF wrfout files (python + electron) that can be used on most of the operating systems.

Project motivation is to create a desktop application that can read netCDF files. And allow the user to choose a variable from the list of available variables from that file. 

Similar to the "NCVIEW" which is a widely used application to visualize the netCDF formatted files.

## Technology stack - Electron and Python

Electron is a non conventional technology to create desktop applications that can run on all operating systems.
